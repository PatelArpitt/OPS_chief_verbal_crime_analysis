services', ' this week we will host a “badge ceremony” in which we will officially welcome the 96 officers who were hired in 2020', ' the standards for becoming a police officer are the most stringent they have ever been ', ' at the same time, we have worked hard and continuously ', '3 to remove unfair and unnecessary barriers that have previously kept excellent potential police applicants from all communities from successfully completing our hiring processes', ' this approach has b een successful in bringing in very qualified, high quality candidates who reflect the skills and enthusiasm we need and the community we serve', ' these changes have had a massive impact on the quantity, quality and diversity of the police recruit applicant pool such that the december 2020 class of 48 recruits was the most diverse class in the history of the ops', ' 1', ' 40% identify as women 2', ' 50% identified as a member of a racialized group 3', ' 6% identified as an indigenous person 4', ' 5%

college degrees and they bring a wealth of experience ranging from previous careers or volunteering in social work, the john howards society, the ottawa distress centre, mental health case work and y outh outreach', ' we could not have done this without the support of this board, the work of our recruiting teams, and, perhaps most importantly, the support of our community partners who encouraged us, guided us, and sent us qualified and skilled candidates for these positions', ' this is a success formula that we will build upon in all other aspects of police service delivery', ' because of the outbreak of the global covid pandemic in 2020, we could not do this ceremony to hono ur these new recruits, their famili es and the communities that supported them ', ' this badge c eremony is long overdue - but - it will be completely compliant with covid regulations', ' this is not the next generation of officers', ' this is a truly new generation of officers who will help lead the ops into a

immediately responded', ' one officer immediately went to the shooting victim and applied lifesaving first aid', ' the remaining officers pursued the suspect on foot through the crowded market ', ' during the foot pursuit, the suspect turned and fired his handgun at the pursuing officers narrowly missing one of them', ' ', '5 after an extremely difficult and dangerous foot pursuit, the officers arrested the suspect and recovered the crime gun', ' the arresting officers discovered that the crime gun apparently jammed which meant that the violent suspect could have intended to engage in an even more dangerous firefight in his attempt to evade arrest', ' the man was charged with attempted murder, point ing a firearm and several other firearms -related offences', ' the security guard suffered non -life-threatening injuries', ' without regard for their personal safety, our officers ran towards danger, saved the life of the victim and arrested an extremely violent and dangerous

pandemic and its economic fallout, the urgent need to address historic systemic racism and other acts of discrimination, and growing social inequality, the expanding opioid and mental health crises and an alarming level of polarization in our society', ' despite these unprecedented crises, the ops remains committed to reforming, restructuri ng and realigning the service - to be better individually and collectively, to better -meet the needs of all of the ottawa residents we serve and protect, and to better meet the needs of all of the ops members who serve and protect the community', ' the ops h as been relentlessly pursuing cultural and organizational change with a hyper focus on improving : \\uf0b7 public trust – to ensure our thoughts, decisions , actions and systems improve ops member and public trust in our service', ' \\uf0b7 duty of care – to demonstrate every day and in every way a greater duty of care for all of our ops members and all of our community members ', ' \\uf0b7 community safety and well -being – to work together internally as “one team” so that we can form better community partnerships to co-produce integrated services and joint solutions that will improve safety and well -being in all neighbo urhoods ', ' in addition to our overall organizational change efforts, the ops multi -year change budget identified the following priority projects to be delivered in 2021 ; \\uf0b7 new measures to improve our response to people in mental health crises \\uf0b7 new anti -black and anti -indigenous training \\uf0b7 addition of five members to saca/pau including vaw and mmig coordinators \\uf0b7 expansion of nrts to suburban and rural communities \\uf0b7 additional financial and human resources for ops member health and wellness we will keep the board and the public informed with regular updates on the status of these projects', ' we know that we must rid our organization and our institution of people, practices and systems that undermine our efforts to build trust, improve our duty of care and advance community safety and well -being ', ' this difficult work continues with a growing critical mass of ops members stepping up, speaking out , and standing up to do the right things', ' words matter but deeds speak ! i am seeing significantly positive changes in the way that our members speak and act – this is increasingly reflected in the feedback that i receive from many of the most marginaliz ed, victimized and racialized community members', ' ', '2 the members of the ops continue to deliver needed and invaluable police service s on a 24-7/365 basis to the one million residents of the city of ottawa where they demonstrate incredible acts of profession alism, compassion and operational excellence', ' hate crime i now want to make a statement of support to our asian community and our vaw community after the terrible , tragic hate-fueled deaths of eight people in atlanta last week – six of the murdered were asian women – seven of the eight people murdered were women ', ' from my perspective as chief here in the nation’s capital, what took place in atlanta is a hate crime that victimized those directly murdered or injured, their famili es, the asian community and women (locally an d internationally)', ' i have been tracking intelligence reports as well as media reports and find remarkable that there is even any real debate about the intentions of this murder er’s actions – there is no deba te about the impact of his criminal action', ' regardless, the ops has acted as if this was a u', 's', ' -based hate crime with local implications here in ottawa', ' that is, we immediately deployed our e quity diversity and inclusion (edi) unit to reach out to ou r asian and female members as well as our asian and vaw community leaders', ' we had our intelligence/hate crime units monitoring for online and physical threats locally', ' finally, we advised all of our patrols to be vigilant on these issues and to be proacti ve patrolling to prevent any related threats', ' in 2020, the number of reported incidents targeting people of asian descent increased to 14 from 2 in 2019 ', ' members of our service continue to reach out to the asian community to express our support and our commitment to everyone’s safety', ' neighbourhood resource team members have been engaged to work with community contacts and uniformed police presence has been increased', ' we continue to make contacts with key leaders in the community to strengthen ties and extend our messages in multiple languages', ' we also are aware of how this tragedy intersects with violence against women', ' we are working to strengthen our working relationship with local groups', ' the report on this month’s agenda outlines that work', ' over the weekend, i was saddened to hear that even our mayor was victimized in a hate incident , with graffiti outside his home', ' our hate crime unit is investigating this hate incident', ' ', '3 there is no room for homophobia or any other form of discriminatory, hate fueled acts in our service, our city or our society ', ' all hate incidents should be reported and will be fully investigated', ' we ask that anyone who has been a victim of a hate -motivated incident to contact us so we can help', ' you can do that either by calling 613 -236-1222 or you can file a report online at ottawapolice', 'ca/onlinereporting', ' international women’s day earlier this month, we celebrated international women’s day', ' women – sworn and civilian – have made and continue to make incredibly strong and growing contributions to our service, our city and our society', ' it’s our collective responsibility to ensure that this organization recruits and supports women, while creating a safe workplace conducive to achieving their career aspirations', ' this year’s iwd theme is #choosetochallenge', ' we can all “choose to challenge” by calling out gender -bias and inequality in support of an inclusive workforce that values the unique contributions and skills of every member', ' replica guns we continue to see a high number of authentic looking replica firearms being used out in the public or in the commission of crimes', ' it has resulted in a number 911 calls from the community to the ops over the past three months', ' since the start of this month 30 fake replic a handguns have been recovered by the ottawa police service; last year we recovered over 260 ', ' this is trend presents a safety issue for both the community and our officers because each call must be initially responded to presuming it is a real firearm un til it can be otherwise determined ', ' the use fake or replica firearms to commit a crime results in the same penalties as using a real firearm', ' opiod & mental health crises health experts acknowledge that issues related to mental health and addictions have been exacerbated by the pandemic', ' there is a lot of suffering and pain and our members are seeing it on the street every day', ' almost daily, ops officers are responding to community calls for people in mental health and/or addictions related crises – in many cases these persons are t hreatening self-harm or are at risk of harming others ', ' ', '4 in 2020, ottawa police responded to 542 calls for service related to overdoses', ' last year ops officers used naloxone 115 times, saving 103 lives', ' this year, we have responded to 91 calls for service involving drug overdoses', ' our officer’s ability to administer naloxone along with our teamwork with the paramedics and the fire department has led to successful interventions in the majority of these cases', ' t ragica lly though , we are seeing far too many members of our community dying as result of drug overdose ', ' we are continuing our hard work with our partners, like ottawa public health, to continue to advise and warn residents about the risks of illegal drugs, bu t this recent upward trend is alarming, and we need to reinforce preventative educational measures and ensure multiple life -saving supports are available to reduce incidents of overdose in our city', ' 24 hours in a 24-hour period last week, i experienced some of the most inspirational and some of the most troubling moments in my 30-year police career', ' first let me describe what inspired me', ' it started with a drive up to the le itrim station where i had the hono ur and pri vilege to present chief’s commendations to two neighbo urhood resource team officers, constables eric douglas and wayne clayton', ' the commendations were for an event which occurred last year when eric and wayne were on patrol and came across a serious motor vehicle accident where three people were trapped inside a burning vehicle', ' eric and wayne, were able to successfully rescue two people', ' despite the heroic efforts of the two officers, the third person unfortunately later succumbed to their injuries', ' eric and wayne then told me about another situation they were dealing with that related to an event that occurred in november 2019 which indirectly involved me during my first week as chief', ' at the time, i was on patrol with wayne, e ric and the rest of t heir carlington nrt when we investigated a male who was involved in a criminal code driving offence', ' during the investigation, i met the suspect’s spouse and some of her young kids', ' it was clear to me that the parents and children were struggling with a number of socio -economic issues at the time', ' the nrt officers continued the investigation but , ultimately, used their discretion to not lay any charges because they believed the male was trying to turn his life around and raise his young family', ' nrt of ficers eric douglas and wayne clayton remained in contact with the family in an effort to try to help them', ' just over a year later, eric and wayne learned that the mother had tragically passed away from a drug overdose leaving the father alone to look after the young kids', ' eric ', '5 and wayne co uld see that this was a potentially critical situation so they took immediate action to assist the family', ' first, they arranged with the local food bank to get the family some food', ' then they raised funds to buy christmas gifts for the kids', ' the officers are currently working with social service agencies and the father to try to get him stable employment so he can look after his family', ' for me this second event involving wayne and eric was even more impactful than their life-saving efforts during the car accident', ' the rescue incident was an example of bravery and courage at the highest levels of the profession of policing – it is a deed that demonstrates that every day we have police officers who run towards a nd into danger to rescue others', ' the second event spoke to their professional use of discretion in a criminal investigation and their personal compassion to help this young man and his family …this is the heart and soul of community policing ! shortly i after , i was made aware of an emergency response police operation that had just concluded a short distanc e from the station where i had met with eric and wayne ', ' a 911 call had come in regarding a car -jacking incident involving a suspect who was armed with a handgun', ' the responding frontline officers intercepted the car and safely arrested the suspect who was found in possession of a fully loaded semi -automatic firearm', ' our frontline officers did a textbook high -risk takedown and seized yet another crime gun from a dangerous offender', ' our investigators conducted a professional thorough investigation and laid a total of 12 charges against the offender including, kidnapping, possession of a firearm, and using a weapon in committing a criminal offence', ' i learned of all of these acts of police bravery, courage, discretion, compassion and operational/inve stigative excellence literally within the space of an hour ', ' as i said, this was one of the most inspirational sequence of events that i have experienced in my police career', ' the next 12 hours , however, would prove to be some of the most troubling in my career', ' that evening, i took part in a community meeting as part of the ops’ international day for the elimination of racial discrimination', ' the event included the community members sharing stories about their interactions with our ops officers, some of them quite devastating', ' if the stories were true, they would be considered acts of misconduct, and if they were not true, they clearly demonstrated the low level of trust and faith that they had in our service', ' ', '6 but the highlight of the event was when a community member asked a question of a panel member, sergeant white of the minneapolis police departmen t', ' the question was “w hat she felt like on may 25 , 2020 , when george floyd was murdered by another mpd police officer ?” sergeant white is a highly decorated and respected 17 -year police veteran', ' she is also black', ' she was at work on that tragic day – she advises that she was sitting at her desk watching the live feed and she broke dow n sobbing in tears', ' she was crying for the loss of life, she was crying as black woman wo had herself faced racism, and she was crying for what she knew would be a devastating impact to the reputation of the minneapolis police department and the policing institution globally ', ' it was a very difficult discussion but an important conversation for the ops and the community to have', ' the meeting ended on a positive note with commitments from community members and service members alike to keep the dialogue going and to continue to work together , to rebuild trust , and to prevent any more tragedies from happening', ' later at home, i got myself caught up on the news of the abduction, rape and murde r of a 30-year-old woman, sara everard , in london england ', ' the news reports advised that the police had made an arrest in th e case – the person accused of committing this murder was a serving london met police officer', ' over the 24 hours i had seen the very best of the policing institution; courage, compassion and crime fighting', ' i had then been confronted with the very worst of the police profession', ' we have our own long and terrible history of ops members who have been found guilty of major misconduct and criminal code offences', ' we have far too many ops members who, by acts of omission, fail to speak up or stand up for those being victimized or bullied , in the service or in the community', ' as an organization, we must do more to admit, own and do somethi ng to address these cultural and organizational issues', ' to be clear, this is about both individual and systemic failures in the ops ', ' so our service’s commitment to duty of care, public trust and community safety and well-being are far more than philoso phical discussions , priority projects or strategic plans ', ' every person who considers themselves a leader in this organization is going to have to put their body, hearts, minds and souls into the effort of addressing these issues', ' ', '7 conclusion as i state d at the start of my speech, we have made a lot of progress in the past 18 months to address these issues… but…there is much more work to be done', ' i believe we have the leadership within the ops and the leadership within the community to get this done ! thank you – merci beaucoup',

-election', ' on behalf of the entire service we look forward to your continued leadership', ' as we go thr ough this period of challenge and change, the members of the command, the ops and i welcome this continuity of leadership', ' your passion for progressive public service and your commitment to effective police oversight are critically important to ou r future success in building a police service that our community members and service members deserve', ' covid -19 the ops continue s to support dr', ' vera etches and the ottawa public health team’s lead effort s to manage the covid pandemic ', ' we work in trust-based partnerships composed of a wide variety of civil society agencies and actors to jointly achiev e mutually desired public health and community resiliency outcomes ', ' i would like to thank all essential frontline workers -- healthcare workers, public health staff, first responders, city workers, community agencies, grocery , delivery people – quiet heroes from all walks of life (including ops members ), who work every day to provide vital services to our community', ' your compassion, courage and commitm ent to a duty of care have served the community ', ' your example validates my own vision for the future of the ops; “delivering neighbo urhood policing through trust -based community partnerships that co -produce s improved community safety and well -being', ' building a police service that allows every community member and every service member to feel and be properly supported and respected ', '” change to achieve such a vision the ops must overcome significant challenges and implement major changes', ' we were faced with making a seismic shift ', 'in how design and deliver police services – how we work in and with community', ' while it may seem like a daunting task, this is precisely the reason why i applied to be the ops chief and why this board hired me for t he top cop job', ' since my fist day on the job, my vision has been both validated and refined through difficult discussions and hard working conversations with opsb members, ops members, community members , city officials, subject matter experts, academics over zoom meetings, at public protests, during board meetings , community equity council meetings , and our own human rights forum', ' while listening and learning we were also busy building more effective partnerships with community stakeholders from every part of this city – people invested in a wide variety of issues affecting this city', ' because of efforts like this , we were able to implement t he following needed changes over the past year despite the fact that we faced seemingly endless series of crises over the past 12 months: \\uf0b7 added three new neighbourhood resource teams in the byward market/lowertown, bayshore and centretown neighbourhoods ; \\uf0b7 reduced h omicides and shootings by 40% respectively ; \\uf0b7 seized a record number of crime guns ( 104); \\uf0b7 issued over 40,000 tickets including 450 for stunt d riving ; \\uf0b7 administered naloxone 115 times resulting in 1 03 lives saved ; \\uf0b7 received record number of police applications ( 2,700 up from 650) ; \\uf0b7 hired 96 new police recruits (32 female , 31 self -identified racialized /indigen ous male ) with a wide range of lived experiences from working in family services , homeless shelters , harm reduction programs, victim support services and mental health support ; \\uf0b7 created the equity, diversity and inclusion (edi) action plan ; \\uf0b7 implemented the respect, values and inclusion (rvi) directorate, which is comprised of two sections – a respect, ethics and values (rev) section focused on supporting professional, ethical, values ; \\uf0b7 expanded the role of the community equity council (cec) to have direct and timely discussions with key community leaders about the issues that are important to racialized, indigenous and faith -based communities ; and ', '\\uf0b7 coordinated a major organizational restructuring that affected over 60% of the units and directorates to improve the ops’ ability to (re)build public trust, to demonstrate a greater duty of care in every interaction , and to co-produce community safety and well-being outcomes ', ' good work being done i like to invite the board, the media , and the public to review the complete content in agenda item #26 – letters of commendation for the members of the ops', ' here are but a few examples of the work that the qui et hero es of the ops did in the month of december 2020 and that the y do on a daily basis in the service of this city: “there are some massive problems with drug housing in our neighbourhood, and constable tristan bailey has helped by increasing patrols and keeping an eye on our street', ' his presence has been a real help in reducing drugs being sold and people using those drugs at the local school and around the street', '” and “since last march i have dealt with 16 police officers due to my son’s severe autism', ' i would like to thank them all', ' they were all amazing and i appreciate it so much', ' in a moment of crisis there were no other options but to call 911 to assist my son and i did so without hesitation', ' they were all so helpful', ' thank you for being so underst anding in such unique circumstances', '” and “hi i just wanted to say thank you to the 911 operator and the brave police officers who helped save my father today', \" he suffered a stroke this morning but was able to call 911, his speech was severely impaired and i'm sure that the operator was unable to understand a single word he was trying to say\", \" the responding officers made the decision to break down his front door when they didn't get a response, and by making that decision they may just have saved his life\", '” and ', '“i am a physician in the emergency room at the the ottawa hospital', ' there was a patient having a mental health crisis and two of your officers, constables eric lepage and feisel bila houssein were instrumental in the care of this patient', ' they conducted themselves in a truly exemplary manner, of the highest professional standard', ' they demonstrated an insightful understanding of what mental health patients need in a difficult crisis, and were e ffective not just at de -escalation, but indeed offering genuinely empathetic support and constructive ideas and positive reinforcement (on top of a ride home)', '” and “our son has been struggling with mental health issues over the past several months and thi s has resulted in several calls to ops regarding concerns for his safety', ' i received a follow -up call from cst', ' lauren dupasquier and once again was shown nothing but extraordinary compassion, understanding, kindness and professionalism', ' she offered her expertise while providing suggestions and resources and all with a touch of humour', ' she has continued to provide support with a follow -up \"check in\" visits with our son and our family', ' i cannot express the heartfelt gratitude i have for all she has done', '” 2021 change budget as we enter 2021 , i can assure the board and the public that the ops will not be taking our foot of gas pedal , or our focus off the vision that i articulated earlier', ' in fact , we established the 2021 budget as a change -\\nenabling budget based on an ongoing series of community consultation s', ' through budget process the ops has committed itself to the public, the board , and the city to accomplish the following in partnership with the affected community stakeholders: mental health response strategy : you will hear more about this later in agenda item #7 from deputy chief steve bell', ' through a new approach to community consultation and co-\\nproduction partnership s with mental healthcare and addictions professionals, community -based organizations , academics and those with ', 'lived experience , to design and implement a whole -of-community approach to responding to those persons dealing with mental health and addictions issues ', ' expanded neighbourhood policing strategy : additional neighbourhood resourc e teams (nrts) will be deployed in suburban and rural neighbourhoods , in addition to the six nrts currently deployed in our urban areas', ' the expansion will come from the 20 new permanent hires – this will be a combination of police officers and civilian members with backgrounds in areas such as mental health and addictions , social services and youth outreach to name but a few ', ' these o fficers will serve our suburban and rural areas', ' the expanded nrt’s will work with local residents to build trust, integrate services, prevent and solve crimes all the while working in and with community to improv e community safety and well -being ', ' training/equity, diversity and inclusion: there will be a greater focus on organizational training and the ro ll out an edi training toolkit , anti-indigenous/anti -black racism and de -escalation training – this will include conducting an efficacy review for all ops -related training', ' the ops will begin the process of co -production of training with community – from d esign to implementation to evaluation', ' violence against women: five new investigators will be added our sexual assault and child abuse section and our partner assault section', ' two of these positions will be “coordinat ors” – one to provide direct suppor t to the vaw community and the other to provide direct support to the indigenous community in order to advance the recommendations re “m issing and murdered indigenous women and girls”', ' members health, safety and wellness: there will be further significant investment s in member health, safety and wellness by adding four new positions to provide full time supports to our members', ' we will also complete and evaluate the pilot project involving ruben thomlinson (a third-party pro vided for intake and investigations for all types of harassment , including sexual harassment )', ' this pilot evaluation will be part of the larger report and recommendations stemming ', 'from the board/service project to address “workplace sexual violence & harassment ', '” mindset shi ft please know that t here is a growing recognition across policing in canada and within the ops that the traditional model of policing needs to change and evolve', ' we hear that from our community, the board , and our own members', ' change is needed , change is happening , and more change is coming', ' it’s becoming clear that in order to achieve that change we need to shift how we think , act and work as an organization ', ' we must continually strive to better -understand and personally identify with the issue s our communities face – to better -partner with those same communities to help co-produce the solutions to the local problems ', ' today and every day, going forward , we will relentlessly focus on three things: 1', ' public trust - to ensure our thinking, actions and systems will improve member trust and public trust', ' 2', ' duty of care – to demonstrate for the community and one another that we truly care for each other ', ' 3', ' community safety and well -being – to work in partnership with community to co -produce improved community safety and well -being ', ' we need to ensure that our approach to policing avoids exposing people (community members and our ops members alike) to additional risks through our policies, systems and/or actions', ' we must seek the lowest possible police intervention and the most optimal social intervention (s) to achieve the best outcome s for the community and the service ', ' of course, all of these efforts must be achieved using the p rinciples and best practices around equity, diversity and inclusion', ' community collaboration & co -production this change involves every service member', ' but i also hope – the service hopes that this change will involve every board member and every ', 'communi ty member', ' w e can only do this when we work together as one service and one team ', ' regardless, a ll members must recognize that change starts at an individual level — that we must challenge ourselves in how we think and perform our duties – we must challenge our policies, systems and programs - with a greater focus on duty of care, public trust , and community safety and well -being', ' all new ops strategies, policies and practices will be community informed and involved – with community co -production through consultation with community stakeholders s and evidence -based best practices', ' this is just the beginning of a discussion that has already started within our service and with our community', ' i look forward to continuing it in the months and years ahead', ' thank you /merci beaucoup!

15, retired ops constable guy giroux died in a tragic incident', ' he was 63 years old', ' we were equally saddened to learn of the passing of former ops youth officer guy giroux', ' i have been told

of shootings, up by 60% from five years ago (despite recent decreases in the last year), is evidence of this fact', ' we know that an enforcement -based approach to crime reduction will not work alone', ' a focus on prevention over enforcement while addressing the root causes of crime is the only path to improved public safety', ' we must use the cswb process to deliver public value by

thousands of officers , police members and canadians from across this great country ', ' instead , yesterday’s formal ceremony only included 25 p articipants , but was live -streamed to allow a wider

pandemic ', ' we have been working under the leadership of dr ', ' vera etches and her ottawa public health team – together with city by -law and oth er front line community partners ', ' we have focused first and foremost on education and engagement , along with the careful but effective use of enforcement to flatten the covid curve while contributing to significant health outcomes ', ' the ops has coordinated our efforts with the opa, soa and the board to keep our own members informed, equipped and healthy resulting in only six of our members contracting the virus to date', ' we have used compassion and innovation to provide the needed personal protection equipment , de-contamination stations , and timely health information for our members and their families', ' ', '3 we managed to achieve these successes despite losing $13', '5 million from our 2020 operating budget due to the in -year covid impacts ', ' crime management success covid 19 has had varying impacts on local crime, traffic and social order issues that the ops deals with in the nation’s capital', ' despite that, o ur members are doing exceptional work and achieving previously unmatched crime management success es in 2020 ', ' where other big cities across ontario and canada have seen an increase in the number of shootings year to date , ottawa has an almost 30% decrease - by this time in 2019 we had 54 shootings but so far this year we ha ve had only 38 shootings', ' this year our homicide unit has laid murder char ges in all six of the homicides that occurred in ottawa – an unheard of and unprecedented solvency r ate', ' the ops homicide unit deserves high praise for their ability to provide compassionate victim services while also giving a significant sense of closure and justice to families who have lost loved ones in such violent and tragic circumstance s', ' we continue to try to build on this positive local trend by taking a whole -of-\\nservic e approach to reducing gun violence in ottawa', ' our intelligence unit and crime a nalysts are increasingly innovative and effective i n identifying the high risk people, places and events that are major contributing factors in street -level gun violence', ' our undercover and investigative units have effectively implemented firearms interdiction strategies and gang enforcement measures , all the while supporting successful criminal prosecution s', ' our uniform front line officers respond quickly and effectively to firearms -\\nrelated calls across this city and have a remarkable record of arresting the offenders and seizing crime guns (the ops has seized 78 crime guns in 2020) ', ' our neighbourhood resource teams , crime prevention officers and school resource offic ers are building trust with the local residents while working with the local community stakeholders to solve problems, prevent crime , and address the underlying criminogenic factors', ' ', '4 in fact, the criminal investigative directorate specifically credits the effectiveness of the five new neighbourhood resource teams as the single differentiating factor for the reduction in violent street crime in ottawa', ' that is why the ops will continue to expand the neighbourhood policing strategy such that it will b ecome the core of our operating model to build public trust while improving community safety and well -being', ' traffic management success no matter where i go in the city, one of the top concerns i hear about is traffic safety - specifically in the post -covid period where we hear increased concerns about speed ing, dangerous driving and excessive noise on and around our road ways', ' in response, the ops traffic services team launched two major initiatives: 1', ' “operation overwatch” – since it launched officers have issued 5,000 tickets for speeding, stunt driving, and distracted driving 2', ' “project noisemaker” - since it lau nched officers have issued 2,500 tickets and laid 8 criminal charges i want to congratulate the traffic services team and all other ops units who have contributed to making our roadways safer and our neighbourhoods more liveable ', ' as our kids return to school we will conti nue to focus our efforts on these traffic safety issue s', ' order management success every year the ops is faced with community safety and well -being issues that have little if anything to do with core policing and/or criminal justice – the most prominent of these are mental health addictions and youth related issues', ' the confluence of crises has exacerbat ed the overall stress our youth are facing while also causing more mental health and addi ction crises in the general population ', ' over the course of 2020, ottawa police members have achieved significant successes in managing these various forms of social disorder', ' mental health c risis ', '5 so far in 2020, the ops have responded to 6,000 mental health calls for service', ' the vast majority of these are han dled with no injuries to anyone and no use of force', ' many of these calls we believ e can and should be handled by service providers other than the police once there has been sufficient planning, implementation and evaluation', ' regardless, there will always be a need for some element of police intervention in mental health calls', ' for instance last week the ops were called to an address in barrhaven for a very high risk volatile incident ', ' the call involved a male experiencing a mental health crisis during which he barricaded himself in a house with access to a number of firearms', ' after nearly 1 1 hours of negotiation, ops members eventually c onvinced the m an to exit the residence where he was taken by officers to hospital for assessment', ' there was n o use of force used and no one was injured', ' the ops members involved in this call used professionalism and compassion to peaceful ly resolve this critical incident – they had direct support from local community members along with our on-call psychologist', ' this is a great example of a “whole of service” response to high risk calls – the units involved included communications centre, opsoc, tactical, frontline, and victim services ', ' these units worked together with health care practitioners and community partners to successful ly resolve volatile and potentially v iolent situation s', ' opioid c risis ops members are on the front lines battling both the covid and opiod crises ', ' all ops officers are trained on how to administer naloxone and carry it with them', ' we are often the f irst and fastest to respond in these med ical emergencies , when mere minutes can mean the difference between saving and losing a life', ' for example , on september 15th, 2002 ops officers r

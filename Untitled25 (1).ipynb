      "['1   Chief’s verbal for Police Services Board Meeting –   May 31, 2021     Good afternoon everyone, bon après midi tous.', 'Gun & Gang Violence     This been a very tragic and difficult period for Ottawa and the Ottawa Police Service.', 'Too many young lives have been needlessly lost.', 'Too many families are grieving and suffering.', 'Too many people are fighting for their lives in hospital,     Too many community members in too many neighborhoods are fearful for their safety.', 'Too many paramedics and hospital staff were invo lved in heroic medical efforts to  manage the flood of victims as well as to provide support for their families all the while  still battling COVID.', 'Too many OPS members have had to manage the significant stress and troubling  trauma related to these shootin g events - from dispatching the 911 calls, to responding  to actual in -progress violent crimes, to managing multiple horrific crime scenes, to  investigating complex multi -jurisdictional cases, to providing immediate and ongoing  victim services, to providing  ongoing community supports in the days after the actual  events.', 'There were several instances when our officers arrived at these shootings in time to  attempt first aid and CPR for the victims – some of those efforts by our officers were  successful and o thers, tragically, were not.', 'All of those efforts took a huge toll on our  members.', 'This type of violence is simply unacceptable.', 'We all know that this level of violence is  not the result of a simple set of circumstances nor will it be solved with simpl e  solutions.', 'It is the result of a number of societal failures which ultimately leads to  violence.', 'The members of the OPS remain committed to being part of a larger “whole of city  effort” improve the social determinants of health…to address the root causes of  crime…to improve community safety and wellbeing especially for those places and  people who are most affected by the crimes...ultimately we must all work together to  find new solutions to reduce and prevent the type of violence that we have just  experienced.', 'That said, the Ottawa Police Service knows that we must take lead in responding to this  major spike in gun related violent crime.', '2     This is why the OPS has escalated our response to this public safety threat – we are in  the process of finalizi ng a major operational plan to address the current wave of gun  violence.', 'This includes deep analysis into the criminal elements behind the crimes as  well as plans for violence suppression, crime prevention and integrated investigations.', 'We will also be v igorously pursuing prosecutions and incarceration for all those persons  responsible for these violent crimes.', 'I have full confidence that our Homicide Unit, Guns & Gangs Unit and Drug Unit will  work in coordination to solve these crimes.', 'In fact, we hav e already, Canada Wide  Warrants for the three suspects in Friday evening’s triple shooting/double homicide.', 'There will be more announcements and arrests to follow.', 'Immediately following my update, the Board will receive a full presentation from  Inspector  Carl Cartright with additional details on the crime analysis and the operational  plan.', 'We have much more to do as a Service, as a city and as a society to truly address gun  related violence.', 'While the police will always play a major role in assessing a nd  addressing this and other complex crime problems, we know that there must be an  expanded role for civil society, community stakeholders, academia and not for profit  organizations in developing new solutions to this old problem.', 'We will be at the table to  help support such efforts.', 'Only through our combined committed coordinated efforts we  will be able to make any real and sustainable progress.', 'MARK FORD     IMAGE: MARK FORD RETIREMENT PARTY     This month, a member who exemplifies those qualities is leaving our Service.', 'I want to take a moment to congratulate and celebrate Acting Deputy Chief Mark Ford  who will be leaving us at the end of June.', 'He will be greatly missed.', 'Mark started his  caree r as a constable with the Ottawa Police Service in October 1987.', 'Since then, he  made a strong and lasting impact on our community and our membership.', 'He has been a leader in emergency planning and tactical operations.', 'He has mentored  many officers, he h as been a catalyst for change and he has formed a host of  police/community partnerships.', 'His father, Retired Chief Brian Ford, was a pioneer developing diversity within our  Service, and his son, rightly followed in his father’s footsteps, spending countles s years  working with the community to develop a broader, and more inclusive approach to  policing.', 'Mark believes in respecting everyone, regardless of position in society or rank in the  Service.', 'In return, he was well respected by community leaders, peers  and 3   subordinates alike.', 'His contributions to the well -being of our members were immense  and his collaborative leadership style will be missed.', 'Thank you, Mark, for your service.', 'NEW EXECUTIVE TEAM     PHOTO OF STEVE/JAMIE/JOAN     With Mark’s departure, we have made some changes on the Command team and  Senior Leadership Team that I want to share with the Board.', 'My Command Team now consists of team of leaders with a wide range of professional  and personal lived experiences.', 'Replacing Mark will be Jamie Du nlop – as Acting Deputy Chief, Jamie will lead the  Community Policing Command…  Jamie has been engaged with the community for  much of his career, particularly the Indigenous community where he has fostered  relationships and programs in relation to VAW issue s and youth and continues today  with being co -chair on our Indigenous Sub-Committee  of the CEC.', 'Joan McKenna will continue in the role of Acting Deputy Chief in charge of the  Intelligence, Info & Investigations Command .', 'And Deputy Chief Steve Bell will continue in the role as Acting Chief Administrative  Officer.', 'This Command team will remain in place until the Board completes its search for a new  CAO.', 'Mark’s retirement also created a permanent vacancy at the rank of Sup erintendent.', 'I  would also like to announce today that I have promoted Superintendent Trish Ferguson  to Superintendent in charge of Front line Policing.', 'Trish has a strong operational  background, she has a long history in investigations, she is an EDI champion who co - founded the women’s employee resource group.', 'Perhaps most importantly she has  great empathy and compassion.', 'One of my commitments as Chief was that the OPS would recruit, develop and promote  a qualified, diverse and effective workforce.', 'As you know, our last recruit class included the highest quantity, quality and diversity of  any previous class - 48 new officers, with 40% identifying as female, 50% self - identifying as racialized, and 6% Indigenous.', 'We are also seeing similar levels of d iversity and quality in our most senior ranks.', 'The  Command Team and Senior Leadership Team is now the most diverse in OPS histor y,  with women representing 26.3% of Executive Command and SLT roles combined, and 4   5.3% of the roles filled by Indigenous member s. Additionally, members of visible  minorities currently represent 21.1% of Executive Command and SLT positions.', 'These  statistics are perceived and include acting positions and members on leave or absent  for other reasons.', 'EXCELLENT WORK BY MEMBERS     Our efforts to advance equity, diversity and inclusion in the OPS is also helping to  improve our ability to improve community policing.', 'It’s about the work that happens  every day by our members working in our neighbo urhoods and with our community.', 'In the past month alone our members have been called to:     \\uf0b7 Managed 42 demonstrations and protests   \\uf0b7 Revived eight  people in overdose using Naloxone   \\uf0b7 Managed 56,000 numbers of people travelling on the interprovincial bridges   \\uf0b7 Investigated 36 robberies and laid  charges in 7    We are not superheroes, but the work we do every day matters.', 'We are there at your  worst moment, to help you, help your family and to make things right.', 'There are many good days and some tragic weekends like we just experienced.', 'Yet,  every now and then we hit it out of the park and every day our members are out there in  the community doing their best to help to make this city safer.', 'ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION – CHILD RESCUED     One of the calls that made headlines and gained a lot of media attent ion was the  abduction of a newborn from an Ottawa family in May.', 'This was a terrifying moment for the mother and family involved.', 'A woman had previously contacted the new mother over Facebook.', 'She arrived at the  home and grabbed the newborn, using bear spray to fend off the mother, and fled.', 'Officers arrived to find neighbours had located the woman and held her until our officers  could detain and arrest her.', 'HISTORICAL SEXUAL ASSAULTS – TEACHERS ARRESTED     In another difficult and disturbing case involving, more than 50 sex related charges were  laid against an Orleans area teacher .', 'I want to thank all of  the young people who came forward to investigators to report  these crimes.', 'It took a lot of courage and we take their trust in us seriously.', '5     I also want to thank the entire investigative team and lead investigator Renee Stewart.', 'A  complex case like this takes experience, professionalism, team work and compassion.', 'Charges against a second teacher were also laid.', 'CHILD IN NEED OF PROTECTION - POTENTIAL SEX OFFENDER     Last week, our 911 Centre received a call from a concerned person about a you ng  teenager in an apartment with a man.', 'A Detective, Admir Minarolli, took the call and attended the address.', 'He was met at the door by a naked resident, and found the boy, clothed and  unconscious on a couch.', 'The man was arrested and charged, and the child taken to CHEO where they  discovered he had been given by marijuana and an unknown drug.', 'Our investigation into this case continues.', 'WATER SAFETY – MARINE RIDE     Our Marine Unit has a tough job.', 'We call upo n them to keep our waterways safe  through enforcement, rescue and education.', 'In early May they launched a drowning awareness campaign because sadly each year  we hear stories of those who have lost their lives due to unsafe conditions or unheeded  safety pr ecautions.', 'On May 22, the MDT team conducted a water RIDE campaign, aimed at raising public  awareness around safe boating practices, and reminding boaters not to drink and boat  or do any water activities after consuming alcohol.', 'But even as these campaigns were underway they were called on for the search of a  young man who fell into the rapids of Hog’s Back Falls.', 'The team spent days searching the Rideau River.', 'If you are swimming, boating, paddle boarding or kayaking in open wat ers, please Be  Safe.', 'TRAFFIC SAFETY -
